## Description
This is **Cibus Recipes**, a **mobile-first** recipe app built in **React** (with Hooks and Context) and tested with the **React Testing Library** (RTL).
<br>Some of the available features are:

><ul>
>  <li>Search for various food and drink recipes;</li>

## Development context
This application was developed as the **final project** in the front-end module of the **Trybe** course (Full Stack Web Development Course).

Divided into random groups of five people, we had to develop the project from scratch, guided by a briefing containing all the requirements and features the application should have.

To achieve this goal, we used methodologies such as **Scrum** and **Kanban**, thus ensuring a better organization, the correct division of work, and the assertive communication expected in a development environment.


## Main used technologies:
>HTML and CSS
>
>React
>
>React Hooks and Context
>
>React Router
>
>React Testing Library (RTL)

## Instructions to check the application
After cloning the repository, you need to install the necessary dependencies with the `npm install` command and start the project with the `npm start` command.

Instead, you can just use the application by yourself **directly in your web browser** by clicking on this **<a href="https://cibus-recipe-app.vercel.app/">link</a>** (*we strongly recommend using the app on your smartphone web browser*).

In any case, you will need to **log in**, and for that, you must use an email in the format **test@email.com** and a password of at least **six characters**.
